            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>3D printed concrete houses represent a significant innovation in the construction industry, offering a new approach to building homes and other structures using large, industrial-sized 3D printers. This process, known as additive manufacturing, builds structures layer by layer, revolutionizing traditional building methods.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="HowTheyAreBuilt" class="tabcontent">
            <h2>How They Are Built</h2>
            <p>The construction of a 3D printed concrete house involves several key steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Digital Blueprint:</strong> A detailed digital blueprint (CAD drawing) of the house is created, outlining all design and measurements, including placement for windows, doors, and utilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Material and Printer Preparation:</strong> 3D slicing software converts the CAD drawing into a printable file. An industrial 3D printer (gantry system or robotic arm) is set up on site, and a specially formulated cement-based mixture is prepared.</li>
                <li><strong>Layer-by-Layer Printing:</strong> The printer extrudes the concrete mixture through a heated nozzle, building the structure layer by layer according to the digital design.</li>
                <li><strong>Solidification and Curing:</strong> Each layer solidifies, sometimes with the aid of a concrete dryer, before the next is added. Proper curing (e.g., maintaining moisture for 24 hours) is essential to prevent cracks.</li>
                <li><strong>Finishing Touches:</strong> After the main structure is printed, traditional construction methods are used to install plumbing, electrical wiring, windows, doors, roofing, and interior finishes.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div id="Benefits" class="tabcontent">
            <h2>Benefits of 3D Printed Concrete Houses</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Speed of Construction:</strong> Significantly reduced construction times, with some homes printed in 12-24 hours and total completion in as little as 10 days.</li>
                <li><strong>Cost Savings:</strong> Automation reduces labor costs (up to 80%) and material waste (up to 95%), leading to overall project cost reduction.</li>
                <li><strong>Design Flexibility:</strong> Enables complex and custom designs, including curved walls and intricate features, that are difficult or expensive with traditional methods.</li>
                <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> Lower material waste, reduced energy consumption during construction (up to 50%), and potential for using sustainable and recycled materials.</li>
                <li><strong>Strength and Durability:</strong> High resistance to extreme weather events (hurricanes, earthquakes) and a potential lifespan of 50-100+ years.</li>
                <li><strong>Addressing Housing Crises:</strong> Rapid and cost-effective construction makes it a promising solution for affordable housing and disaster recovery.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div id="Cost" class="tabcontent">
